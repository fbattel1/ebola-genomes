EBOLA GENOMES

Title: Comparative genomics of lethal and non-pathogenic Ebolavirus species 

Overview: The viral genus Ebolavirus contains six different species, nearly all of which are highly lethal in humans. The species Zaire ebolavirus has caused multiple outbreaks and has a fatality rate up to 90%. Its close relative, Reston ebolavirus, is the only Ebolavirus species to infect humans without causing disease.  We would like to compare the genomes of Reston ebolavirus and Zaire ebolavirus to understand differences that may contribute to pathogenicity. 


Plan
1. Identify a paper and figure we would like to replicate
2. Draft analysis outline 
    a. Familiarize with necessary steps
    b. Familiarize with necessary software
3. Get approvel for analysis outline
4. Begin analysis
