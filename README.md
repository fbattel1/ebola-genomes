EBOLA PROTEOMICS

Title: Comparative proteomics of lethal and non-pathogenic Ebolavirus species 

Overview: The viral genus Ebolavirus contains six different species, nearly all of which are highly lethal in humans. The species Zaire ebolavirus has caused multiple outbreaks and has a fatality rate up to 90%. Its close relative, Reston ebolavirus, is the only Ebolavirus species to infect humans without causing disease.  We would like to compare the protein sequences of Reston ebolavirus and Zaire ebolavirus to understand differences that may contribute to pathogenicity. 


Plan - compare two protein sequences, specifically in the glycoprotein and virulence factor regions
1. Identify a paper and figure we would like to replicate
    a. Not necessarily replicate, but as references:
    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4615121/ 
2. Identify data 
    Ebola zaire proteome: https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000007209 
    Ebola reston proteome:
3. Draft analysis outline - will do in R 
    a. Familiarize with necessary steps
    b. Familiarize with necessary software
4. Get approvel for analysis outline
5. Begin analysis 

Steps
1. Sequence alignment 


- could align protein sequences too
